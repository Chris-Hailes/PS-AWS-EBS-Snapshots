# PS-AWS-EBS-Snapshots
 PowerShell Script for Deleting EBS Snapshots

 This PowerShell script is used to delete EBS Snapshots from AWS account. I use this script to delete EBS snapshots based on specific Tag Key "Name" and filter it by Tag Values "<ServerName-DriveLetter>" which I have configured on my EC2 Instances

This script is set to delete snapshots older than 1 Month from today's date
